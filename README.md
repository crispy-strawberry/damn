# damn
The `damn-core` folder contains the core functionality for
working with the XMPP protocol.
The `damn-bin` folder provides a tui interface over this.

# Plan for the future
1. Build out a minimal working client library in `damn-core`.
2. Try to build a minimal tui in `damn` with `ratatui`.
3. Make some high level and some low level modules and separate them.
4. Try to build a ui with `slint` or `egui` or `dioxus` or `tauri`.

Far Far in the future ....
5. Maybe maybe build a video player interface for the tui with mpv.
